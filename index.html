          Dr. Hannah Xiaoyun Wu is a Research Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.policefoundation.org/staff/hannah-xiaoyun-wu-ph-d/">the National Policing Institute</a>. Her research interests include policing, evidence-based program evaluation, and
          the innovative application of quantitative methods and data analysis to
          challenging criminological problems. Her recent work focuses on understanding the efficacy of everyday proactive police work in reducing crime and accidents and the use of social media by law enforcement agencies in response to critical social
          issues. She has been involved in several randomized and quasi-experiments and is proficient with analyzing data of various types (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal, panel, survey, and GPS location data).
          <br />
          <br />
          Dr. Wu received her M.A. and Ph.D. in Criminology, Law and Society from George Mason University. Prior to joining the NPI, she was a post-doctoral research fellow at the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University and
